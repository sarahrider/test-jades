inscription_text_en: '"The commentary to this poem recounts that this piece was sent
  as a tribute-gift by Satib Al-addin CHECK OFFICIAL SPELLING, the Hakim Beg of Yarkand.
  The Muslims of that area had been infuriated by the corrupt activities of the Qing
  court minister Gao Pu...; Satib al-Addin''s report of Gao''s corruption led to the
  exemption of the local Muslims from paing the following year''s taxes, as well as
  his being awarded the rank of beile or Prince of the (Qing) Imperial Hous. The commentary
  to this poem mentions that this object was made in a ''Muslim City,'' but we do
  not know if this refers to Yarkand itself or to another jade-working center such
  as Agra in northern India." (Taipei 1983 pp97-98) Re: auspicious characters on plaques:
  "These inscriptions are all executed in an unstead, childish calligraphy and with
  much variation in the sizes of the characters. Thus when [QL] receieved this gift,
  in his commemorative poem he stressed that although these words resembled Chinese
  writing, the phrases made no connected sense; howeve, moved by the donors'' honest
  intentions, he accepted this gift with a smile and hoped in this way to promote
  the local culture and customs." (Taipei 1983 p98)'

  "Although historical records show that Gao Pu was executed in Yarkand in 1778, this
  poem is dated [1792], so it is unclear at what time the brush-case was actually
  receieved at court. The QL emperor's eightieth birthday celebrations were held in
  1790 in the Taihedian 太和殿 palace, attendedy by, among others, the headmen of many
  Asiatic tribes. Among these were the Xinjiang Muslim leaders, or Begs; it is therefore
  possible that this pen-and-ink box was presented to the emperor at that time, especially
  in view of of the 萬壽, 'ten thousand years' longevity,' i.e. a birthday greeting,
  and 四夷來賀"respectful greetings from the barbarians of the four quarters" on this
  piece. Since the Muslim leaders would not have been very familiar with Chinese characters
  at that time, such a hybrid artwork would actually have been produced when they
  designed the work, and orderd the local artisans to make it (or else requested the
  Hindustani jade-carvers to do so)." (Taipei 1983 pp98-99)
